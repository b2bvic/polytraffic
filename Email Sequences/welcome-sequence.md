## Email 1: Your Traffic Risk Score Decoded

**Subject:** Your site scored [X] on traffic vulnerability
**Preview:** Here's what that number tells you about structural business risk...
**Send:** Day 0 (immediate)

---

### PASAIDA Breakdown

**Problem**
Most publishers check their score, nod, then do nothing. The number isn't the insight. The allocation data is.

You're running [X]% traffic from [Primary Channel]. When one channel controls 60%+ of your acquisition, three things happen:

1. Algorithm changes become revenue events, not marketing events
2. Your emotional state tracks Google Search Console graphs
3. Planning beyond 90 days becomes impossible

Your score puts you in [risk category]. For publishers at your concentration level, the average revenue drop during a single Google update is 28-42%. Recovery timeline: 3-6 months. Some never recover.

**Agitation**
That's not a marketing problem. It's a structural business vulnerability. You've built a single-point-of-failure into your revenue engine.

**Solution**
The fix isn't "do more SEO" or "try TikTok." The fix is portfolio rebalancing. Same concept as investment diversification, applied to acquisition channels.

Over the next 5 emails, I'll walk you through the framework. Tomorrow: the allocation math that changes everything.

**Action**
Reply to this email with your current traffic split (% by channel). I'll tell you which category you fall into and what your first move should be.

**CTA Button:** (none for Email 1 - relationship building)

## Email 2: The Allocation Math Nobody Teaches

**Subject:** Why your 90/10 traffic split is a liability
**Preview:** The difference between 90/10 and 60/20/10/10 is survival
**Send:** Day 1

---

### PASAIDA Breakdown

**Problem**
You already know you should diversify. You've tried. It failed. You went back to SEO because at least that's predictable.

Here's why that logic inverts reality.

**Agitation**
A 90/10 traffic split (90% organic, 10% everything else) means a 50% algorithm hit kills 45% of your total traffic. You need 90% recovery on your primary channel just to get back to baseline. Most sites never hit 90% recovery. The math compounds against you.

Run the numbers on September 2023 HCU. Affected publishers with 80%+ Google dependency saw average revenue drops of 38%. Average recovery after 6 months: 62% of original traffic. That's a permanent 38% haircut on sites that were doing $20k/mo.

**Solution**
A 60/20/10/10 split (organic, email, social, paid) transforms the same scenario:

- Same 50% organic hit now kills 30% of total traffic (not 45%)
- You have three channels to activate for emergency traffic
- Recovery pressure drops because other channels sustain baseline revenue

The difference isn't marginal. It's the difference between a setback and a shutdown.

**Authority**
This isn't theory. I've audited 200+ publisher portfolios. Sites with HHI scores below 2500 recover 3x faster from algorithm updates. The math holds across niches, monetization models, and traffic volumes.

**Action**
Tomorrow I'll send the correlation matrix. Most publishers diversify wrong because they pick correlated channels. SEO + Google Ads isn't diversification. It's concentration with extra steps.

## Email 3: Channel Correlation (The Diversification Trap)

**Subject:** SEO + Google Ads = concentrated risk
**Preview:** The correlation trap most publishers fall into
**Send:** Day 3

---

### PASAIDA Breakdown

**Problem**
Quick test: During Google's September 2023 Helpful Content Update, did your paid search traffic also drop?

If yes, your channels are correlated. They move together. Same volatility, same risk events. You diversified into the same vulnerability.

**Agitation**
This happens constantly:

- Publisher runs 80% Google organic, 20% Google Ads
- Feels diversified because two channels
- Algorithm update hits, organic drops 40%
- Paid search CPC rises 25% (same advertisers competing for reduced inventory)
- Both channels decline simultaneously

That's not diversification. That's correlation masquerading as strategy.

**Solution**
Real diversification requires low-correlation channels:

| Pair | Correlation |
|------|-------------|
| Google Organic + Email | Low |
| Facebook Organic + Reddit | Low |
| SEO + YouTube | Medium |
| Google Organic + Google Ads | High |
| Facebook + Instagram | High (same company) |

The framework:
- Same platform = high correlation
- Same company = medium-high correlation
- Same audience intent, different platform = medium correlation
- Different intent + different platform = low correlation

**Authority**
I built the correlation matrix from real traffic data across 150 publisher portfolios. Sites that maintained maximum 50% allocation to any correlated channel group saw 60% less revenue volatility during algorithm events.

**Incentive**
I'll send you the full correlation matrix PDF tomorrow. Map your current setup. Most publishers discover their "diversified" portfolio is actually 2-3 highly correlated channels under different names.

**Action**
What channels are you currently running? Reply with your mix and I'll tell you where you're correlated.

**CTA Button:** (none - engagement driver)

## Email 4: Attribution (Your Data Is Lying)

**Subject:** Your analytics say email converts at 0.5%. They're wrong.
**Preview:** Last-click attribution is systematically defunding your best channels
**Send:** Day 5

---

### PASAIDA Breakdown

**Problem**
Google Analytics says paid search drives 40% of your conversions. So you fund it. Email shows 5%. So you deprioritize it.

Six months later, your traffic is more fragile than ever.

**Agitation**
Here's what actually happened:

Last-click attribution (GA4 default) gives 100% conversion credit to the final touchpoint. Paid search and direct traffic look incredible. Email and SEO look worthless.

Reality: Email and SEO are assist channels. They start the relationship. Paid and direct finish it.

When I run multi-touch attribution audits, the numbers flip:

**Last-Click Model (GA4 Default):**
- Paid Search: 40% of conversions
- Direct: 30%
- Email: 5%

**Linear Multi-Touch Model:**
- Email: 25% of conversions
- SEO: 30%
- Paid Search: 25%
- Direct: 20%

Email went from 5% to 25%. No traffic changes. Same conversions. Different accounting.

**Solution**
You're making budget decisions on bad data. Every dollar you move from email to paid search because of last-click attribution compounds your fragility.

**Authority**
I built a multi-touch attribution framework for publishers who don't have $50k/year for enterprise tools. Google Sheets + UTM taxonomy + Zapier. 2 hours to set up. Completely free.

Data from 50+ portfolio audits shows publishers using multi-touch attribution reallocate an average of 15% of their budget. Most of that shifts toward email and organic - the channels last-click systematically undervalues.

**Incentive**
Tomorrow's email covers the two paths forward: build the system yourself (I'll give you the roadmap) or join the next cohort of The Traffic Portfolio (March 3, 2026).

Either way, fix your attribution first. You can't make good allocation decisions with bad data.

**Action**
Reply if you want the attribution framework early. I'll send the Google Sheet template before tomorrow's email.

## Email 5: Two Paths Forward

**Subject:** DIY roadmap vs guided 12-week build
**Preview:** Here's everything you need to fix your traffic portfolio yourself
**Send:** Day 7

---

### PASAIDA Breakdown

**Problem**
You've seen the framework. Traffic concentration creates business fragility. Correlation means fake diversification. Attribution data lies about channel value.

The question isn't whether to fix it. The question is how.

**Solution - Path 1: Build It Yourself**

Complete roadmap:

**Week 1-2:** Audit current allocation
- Calculate HHI score (use the calculator from your risk assessment)
- Map channel correlations (matrix from Email 3)
- Set target allocation (60/20/10/10 starting point)

**Week 3-4:** Fix attribution tracking
- Deploy UTM taxonomy (I'll send the template if you reply)
- Set up Zapier > Google Sheets pipeline
- Run 30-day baseline before making decisions

**Week 5-6:** Select new channels
- Run your business through the selection framework
- Match margin structure, content format, and time budget
- Identify 2-3 highest-probability channels

**Week 7-12:** Test and rebalance
- Launch minimum viable tests ($500 budget, 30-day window)
- Track against kill criteria
- Rebalance based on actual ROI, not projected

Timeline: 4-6 months if you're disciplined.
Cost: Free + your time.
Risk: Most people stall at channel selection or attribution setup.

**Solution - Path 2: The Traffic Portfolio Course**

12-week cohort program. I walk through the buildout with you.

- Week 1-2: Audit + allocation targets
- Week 3-4: Attribution setup (templates provided)
- Week 5-6: Channel selection framework
- Week 7-10: Implementation sprints with weekly reviews
- Week 11-12: Rebalancing protocols + maintenance systems

Includes: Traffic modeling spreadsheet, attribution templates, weekly group calls, private Slack, portfolio teardowns.

**Authority**
Cohort 1 (November 2025): 18 publishers completed the program. 65% achieved positive ROI on at least one new channel within 90 days. Average HHI reduction: 35%. Zero sites hit by the November 2024 spam update lost more than 20% total revenue.

**Incentive**
Price: $497 (one-time)
Next cohort: March 3, 2026
Spots: 25 (currently 8 filled)

**Deadline**
Waitlist closes January 31, 2026. After that, next cohort is June 2026.

**Action**
If you want to build it yourself, do it. The frameworks are in these emails. Reply if you want the attribution template.

If you want the templates, accountability, and compressed timeline, join the waitlist.

Either way, fix your allocation. Monoculture works until it doesn't. When it breaks, you won't have time to build alternatives.
