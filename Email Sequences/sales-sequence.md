# Sales Sequence: The Traffic Portfolio Course Launch

Audience: Waitlist subscribers who completed the welcome sequence.
Trigger: Course enrollment opens.
Duration: 7 days.
Offer: $497 one-time payment. 25 spots per cohort.

## Email 1: Doors Open

**Subject:** Enrollment is open (72 hours only)
**Send:** Day 0 (Launch Day, 9am ET)

---

The Traffic Portfolio opens for enrollment today at 9am ET.

Closes Friday at 11:59pm ET.

25 spots. That's it.

Cohort 1 (November 2025) filled in 48 hours. I cap enrollment because I personally review every portfolio audit and run live teardowns on weekly calls. More than 25 people breaks that.

Here's the situation you're walking into:

You're running 70-90% of your traffic from one channel. Probably Google organic. Maybe Facebook if you're in ecomm. The channel works. Your business depends on it. And every 4-6 months, something happens.

September 2023: Helpful Content Update wipes 60% of affiliate organic traffic in 48 hours.

March 2024: Core Update hammers informational content sites.

November 2024: Spam update catches legitimate publishers in the crossfire.

December 2024: Core Update drops 35% of indexed pages for YMYL sites.

The pattern is predictable. Google ships an update. Publishers scramble. Revenue tanks. Recovery takes 3-6 months. Then it happens again.

You've watched this cycle play out. You know you should diversify. You've told yourself you'll get to it when things calm down.

Things don't calm down.

The Traffic Portfolio is a 12-week system for building multi-channel traffic infrastructure. You'll walk out with attribution tracking, channel allocation targets, and a maintenance protocol you can run in 5 hours per week.

$497. One payment. Lifetime access to materials.

If you're ready: [Enrollment Link]

If you want to see the full curriculum first, I'll send that tomorrow.

Either way, doors close Friday.

## Email 2: The 12-Week Build

**Subject:** What you'll build in 12 weeks (curriculum breakdown)
**Send:** Day 1

---

Most traffic courses teach one channel.

SEO courses teach SEO. Paid ads courses teach paid ads. Email courses teach email.

This course teaches the layer above: orchestration.

You already know how to drive traffic from individual channels. The problem isn't channel execution. The problem is portfolio architecture. Which channels to run. How much budget to allocate. When to rebalance. How to measure cross-channel ROI without enterprise tools.

Here's the 12-week build:

**Weeks 1-2: Portfolio Audit**

You calculate your current HHI score (concentration index), map which channels are correlated (move together), and identify single-point failure risks. Deliverable: Traffic Risk Report with target allocation percentages.

The math is straightforward. Most publishers have never run it. Their traffic allocation is whatever happened to work historically, not a deliberate strategy.

**Weeks 3-4: Attribution Architecture**

You build a multi-touch attribution system using Google Sheets, Zapier, and a UTM taxonomy I provide. No $50k/year enterprise tools. Deliverable: Working attribution dashboard tracking first-touch, last-touch, and linear contribution models.

GA4 gives you last-click data. Last-click data systematically undervalues email and organic search while overvaluing paid and direct. You're making budget decisions on broken accounting.

**Weeks 5-6: Channel Selection**

You run your business model through the selection framework: margin structure, content format, audience intent, time availability. The output is 2-3 highest-probability channels matched to your specific situation. Deliverable: Channel testing roadmap with success metrics and kill criteria.

Most failed diversification attempts are selection failures, not execution failures. Pinterest doesn't work for B2B SaaS. Paid ads don't work at 15% margins. The framework eliminates wrong-fit channels before you waste time testing them.

**Weeks 7-10: Implementation Sprints**

You activate your selected channels, run 30-day tests, and present results in weekly group calls. I review your data live and recommend optimizations or pivots. Deliverable: 2-3 new traffic channels operational and tracked.

This is the part most people stall on. The accountability structure prevents stalling.

**Weeks 11-12: Rebalancing Protocols**

You build your ongoing maintenance system: quarterly portfolio reviews, rebalancing triggers, algorithm update response playbook. Deliverable: Traffic Portfolio Operating Manual (your custom playbook for the next 12 months).

By Week 12 you'll have a traffic system running on multiple channels with clear attribution, documented protocols, and a maintenance rhythm that doesn't require crisis management.

$497. Cohort 2 starts March 3.

## Email 3: Who This Is For

**Subject:** Don't buy this if you're under $5k/month
**Send:** Day 2

---

The Traffic Portfolio isn't for everyone.

Here's who should join and who should wait.

**Don't join if:**

You're pre-revenue or under $5k/month. Focus on one channel first. Get it working. Diversification is a post-traction problem. If you haven't proven you can drive traffic from one source, splitting attention across three will make things worse.

You run an agency doing client work. Different business model, different portfolio strategy. Your constraint is client retention, not traffic diversification. This framework doesn't translate.

You have zero traffic currently. You need distribution before diversification. Come back when you have 10,000+ monthly sessions from at least one channel.

You want 48-hour tactics. This is a 12-week infrastructure build. If you're looking for a hack to fix traffic this week, this isn't it.

**Join if:**

You're earning $5k-50k/month from 1-2 traffic sources and know it's structurally fragile. You've watched algorithm updates hit other sites and wondered when your number comes up.

You've been burned by algorithm updates before. Maybe you lost 30% of traffic in 2023. Maybe you recovered. Either way, you refuse to be that exposed again.

You've tried other channels randomly and failed. Pinterest didn't work. Paid ads burned money. You went back to SEO because at least that's predictable. Now you want a selection framework instead of random experimentation.

You're willing to invest 5-10 hours per week for 12 weeks. This is a build, not a watch-and-hope program. You'll execute. I'll review. The infrastructure gets built.

This course assumes channel-level competence. You know how SEO works. You've run paid ads. You've managed an email list. The gap isn't channel knowledge. The gap is portfolio orchestration.

If that's where you're at, you're in the right place.

If not, bookmark this. Come back when you hit $5k/month on your primary channel.

## Email 4: The Cost of Waiting

**Subject:** Your next algorithm hit will cost $9,000-$20,000
**Send:** Day 3

---

Let me show you the math on what traffic monoculture actually costs.

**Scenario: $10k/month revenue, 80% from Google organic.**

Algorithm update hits. Call it mild—only 40% organic traffic loss. This happens to someone every 4-6 months.

Revenue impact:

80% of $10k = $8k from organic
40% organic loss = $3.2k/month revenue drop
Recovery timeline: 3-6 months (optimistic)
Total cost: $9,600-$19,200 in lost revenue

That's one algorithm event. They happen regularly. If you're 80%+ dependent on Google, you're playing the update lottery every quarter.

Now add the costs that don't show up in spreadsheets:

Daily anxiety checking Search Console before coffee.

Planning paralysis because you can't forecast beyond 90 days.

The pit in your stomach every time Google announces a core update.

Working weekends to publish more content hoping volume provides safety.

That's the ongoing cost of fragility.

**Contrast: 60/20/10/10 portfolio allocation.**

Same 40% organic hit:

60% of $10k = $6k from organic
40% loss = $2.4k organic revenue drop
But total revenue drops to $7.6k (24% loss, not 32%)
Plus: email, social, and paid channels to activate for emergency traffic
Recovery timeline: 4-8 weeks with channel activation

Cost of the hit: $4,800-$9,600 vs $9,600-$19,200 in the monoculture scenario.

Diversification saves you $4,800-$9,600 per algorithm event.

The Traffic Portfolio costs $497.

You break even on the first update. Everything after that is insurance payout.

The next Google core update is coming. The question is whether you'll be ready.

## Email 5: Case Study

**Subject:** Sarah: 87% Google to 60/25/10/5 in 90 days
**Send:** Day 4

---

Sarah runs an affiliate site in the home decor niche.

November 2025: $18,000/month revenue. 87% from Google organic.

She joined Cohort 1. Here's what happened.

**Weeks 1-2: Audit**

Her HHI score was 7,569. Anything above 4,500 is extreme concentration risk. She was running a single-point-of-failure business without realizing it.

Target allocation: 60% SEO, 25% email, 10% Pinterest, 5% YouTube.

Biggest gap: Zero owned audience. No email list. No subscriber relationship. Every visitor arrived through Google and left through Google.

**Weeks 3-4: Attribution Setup**

She built the UTM taxonomy and Zapier pipeline I provided. Within 10 days she had multi-touch attribution running.

First insight: Email was already assisting 30% of her organic conversions, even though she barely had a list. Visitors were signing up for her newsletter, then coming back through email links before purchasing.

GA4 showed email at 2% of conversions. Multi-touch showed it at 18%. She'd been systematically undervaluing her highest-leverage channel.

**Weeks 5-6: Channel Selection**

She ran through the framework. Pinterest made sense for her niche (visual products, high purchase intent). Email was mandatory (owned audience, zero correlation with algorithm updates).

She ruled out paid ads. Her affiliate margins couldn't support paid acquisition costs. The framework caught this before she wasted $2,000 testing.

**Weeks 7-10: Implementation**

Email list: 0 to 1,200 subscribers in 4 weeks. Lead magnet: "The Ultimate Gallery Wall Planning Guide" (content upgrade on her highest-traffic post).

Pinterest: 50 pins published, $500 in promoted pins to test.

Week 10 traffic: Email driving 8%, Pinterest at 4%. Organic down to 78% (not because it dropped—because other channels grew).

**Weeks 11-12: Rebalancing Protocols**

Final allocation: 75% SEO, 12% email, 8% Pinterest, 5% YouTube (in progress).

HHI score dropped from 7,569 to 5,850. Still concentrated, but improving.

Revenue: Up to $19,500/month. Diversification didn't cannibalize SEO. It added channels.

Her take: "I thought diversification meant sacrificing SEO performance. It didn't. I added channels instead of replacing. Now when the next update hits, I have email and Pinterest to activate."

That's the build. 90 days. Measurable allocation shift. Revenue stable and growing.

March 3 is Cohort 2.

## Email 6: Objections

**Subject:** "I don't have time" and other reasons not to join
**Send:** Day 5

---

Three objections I hear before every cohort.

**"I don't have time to build a multi-channel system."**

You're currently spending 10-15 hours/week on SEO because it's your only channel. When an algorithm hit happens, you spend 2-4 weeks in crisis mode trying to recover.

The Traffic Portfolio is a 12-week build at 5-10 hours/week. After that, maintenance runs 5 hours/week.

Time cost of monoculture: Constant anxiety plus periodic crisis sprints.

Time cost of diversification: 12-week build plus steady maintenance.

One is a treadmill. One is infrastructure.

**"I've tried other channels before. They didn't work."**

You tried random tactics without a selection framework.

Pinterest failed because you're in B2B SaaS and Pinterest users aren't looking for enterprise software.

Paid ads burned money because your margin doesn't support paid customer acquisition costs.

YouTube felt impossible because you hate being on camera and your content format doesn't translate to video.

These aren't channel failures. They're selection failures.

The Channel Selection Framework eliminates wrong-fit channels before you test them. You're not trying everything. You're testing 2-3 channels matched to your business model.

Cohort 1 success rate: 65% of students achieved positive ROI on at least one new channel within 90 days. Industry average for random channel experiments: roughly 20%.

Framework beats tactics.

**"How do I know this will work for my niche?"**

You don't. Neither do I.

That's why we test with minimum viable budgets and defined kill criteria.

Weeks 5-6 you set success metrics for each channel. Weeks 7-10 you run tests. If a channel fails your criteria after 30 days, you kill it and test the next one.

This isn't a guarantee. It's a system for finding what works faster and cheaper than random experimentation.

You'll fail on some channels. Everyone does. The difference is you'll know when to quit and what to try next.

## Email 7: Final Call

**Subject:** 6 hours left
**Send:** Day 6 (6pm ET)

---

Enrollment closes at 11:59pm ET tonight.

You've seen the curriculum. You've seen Sarah's results. You've heard the objections and my responses.

The decision isn't complicated.

Option A: Keep running 70-90% of your traffic through one channel. Hope the next algorithm update misses you. Deal with the anxiety of checking Search Console every morning wondering if today is the day your traffic craters.

Option B: Spend 12 weeks building traffic infrastructure that doesn't depend on Google's whims. Walk out with attribution tracking, diversified channels, and a maintenance protocol you can run in 5 hours per week.

The Traffic Portfolio is $497 one time.

Cohort 2 starts March 3, 2026.

25 spots total. 18 filled. 7 remaining.

After tonight, next cohort is June 2026.
