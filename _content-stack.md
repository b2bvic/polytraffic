## 2. LISEC — Lead Magnets

### Lead Magnet 1: Traffic Risk Assessment & Portfolio Audit
**Title:** The Traffic Portfolio Risk Calculator
**Format:** Interactive quiz (15 questions) + PDF audit report
**Delivery:** Automated email with custom report + Calculator Google Sheet

**LISEC Breakdown:**

**L — Lead with the Problem**
"You check Google Search Console first thing every morning. A 20% traffic drop triggers instant panic. Your revenue lives and dies by algorithm updates you can't control."

**I — Introduce the Mechanism**
"The problem isn't your SEO—it's your traffic portfolio allocation. Just like a stock portfolio concentrated in one sector, a traffic portfolio dependent on one channel is fragile. Portfolio theory shows diversification reduces risk without sacrificing returns."

**S — Show the Solution**
"This Traffic Risk Assessment measures your current channel concentration using the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI), identifies correlated traffic sources, and calculates your risk-adjusted traffic returns. You'll get a custom report showing your traffic vulnerability score and recommended rebalancing strategy."

**E — Explain the Proof**
"Based on data from 200+ publisher portfolios, sites with HHI scores below 2500 (diversified) recover 3x faster from algorithm updates and experience 40% less revenue volatility than concentrated sites (HHI >4000). Your assessment compares you to this benchmark."

**C — Call to Action**
"Take the 3-minute assessment now. Get your Traffic Risk Score, channel allocation recommendations, and a custom rebalancing roadmap. Plus access to the Portfolio Allocation Calculator (Google Sheet template)."

### Lead Magnet 2: Channel Selection Framework (Decision Tree)
**Title:** The Traffic Channel Selection Framework
**Format:** Interactive flowchart (PDF) + Notion template
**Delivery:** Instant download + email with implementation video

**LISEC Breakdown:**

**L — Lead with the Problem**
"Everyone says 'diversify your traffic' but nobody tells you which channels to choose. You've tried Pinterest, failed. Tested paid ads, burned money. Went back to SEO because at least you know it works. Now you're stuck in the same monoculture you're trying to escape."

**I — Introduce the Mechanism**
"Channel selection isn't about trying everything—it's about matching channel economics to your business model, margin structure, and time budget. The wrong channel isn't a failure of execution; it's a failure of selection. The right framework eliminates 80% of options before you test anything."

**S — Show the Solution**
"This decision tree framework asks 12 diagnostic questions about your business (margin, content format, audience intent, time availability) and outputs 2-3 highest-probability channels for your specific situation. Includes channel comparison matrix, minimum viable test budgets, and success metrics for each recommended channel."

**E — Explain the Proof**
"Developed from 50+ traffic portfolio audits with affiliate sites, SaaS companies, and content publishers. Sites using this framework achieve positive ROI on new channels 60% of the time vs 20% industry average for random channel experimentation."

**C — Call to Action**
"Download the Channel Selection Framework now. Stop wasting time on wrong-fit channels. Get your personalized 2-3 channel shortlist in under 10 minutes."

### Lead Magnet 3: Algorithm Update Resilience Playbook
**Title:** The 72-Hour Algorithm Update Response Playbook
**Format:** PDF checklist + Spreadsheet dashboard + Loom video walkthrough
**Delivery:** Instant download package via email

**LISEC Breakdown:**

**L — Lead with the Problem**
"It's 6am. You open Google Search Console. Yesterday's traffic: down 40%. Your stomach drops. You refresh. Still down. You check Twitter—everyone's panicking about a Google core update. Your main revenue source just evaporated and you have no idea what to do in the next hour, let alone the next week."

**I — Introduce the Mechanism**
"Algorithm updates don't kill businesses—poor crisis response does. Sites with pre-built activation protocols recover 3x faster than sites scrambling to improvise. The first 72 hours determine whether you stabilize revenue or spiral into months of decline. You need a response system, not panic-driven tactics."

**S — Show the Solution**
"This playbook contains hour-by-hour actions for the first 72 hours post-update: data collection checklist (Hour 1-6), emergency traffic activation from alternative channels (Hour 6-24), and portfolio rebalancing decisions (Hour 24-72). Includes pre-built email templates, social promotion scripts, and budget reallocation calculator."

**E — Explain the Proof**
"Battle-tested during September 2023 Helpful Content Update (70% of affiliates hit), March 2024 Core Update, and November 2024 spam update. Sites using this protocol maintained 80%+ revenue despite 40-60% organic traffic losses by activating email, paid, and partnership channels within 48 hours."

**C — Call to Action**
"Download the 72-Hour Playbook now. Don't wait for the next update to panic. Have your response system ready before you need it."

## 3. ABRASIVISM + PASAIDA — Email Sequences

### Sequence 1: Welcome/Nurture (5 Emails)
**Audience:** New subscribers from Traffic Risk Assessment lead magnet
**Goal:** Build authority, introduce traffic portfolio concepts, soft pitch to course waitlist

---

**Email 1: Your Traffic Risk Score (What It Means)**
**Subject:** Your site scored [X] on traffic vulnerability
**Preview:** Here's what that number actually tells you about your business risk...

**PASAIDA Element:** Problem
Most publishers check their score, nod along, then do nothing. The score isn't the insight—the allocation data is. You're currently running [X]% traffic from [Channel]. That's not a marketing problem. That's a structural business risk.

Three things happen when one channel controls 60%+ of your traffic:
1. Algorithm changes become revenue events (not marketing events)
2. Your daily emotional state tracks Google Search Console graphs
3. You can't plan beyond 90 days because traffic is too volatile

Your score puts you in [risk category]. That means [specific consequence for their business].

The fix isn't "do more SEO" or "try TikTok." The fix is portfolio rebalancing—same concept as investment diversification, applied to acquisition channels.

Over the next 5 days I'll walk you through the framework. Day 2 starts with the allocation math.

— Vic

**Email 2: The Allocation Math (Why 60/20/10/10 Beats 90/10)**
**Subject:** Why your 90/10 traffic split is killing you
**Preview:** The math behind portfolio allocation (no, this isn't boring)

**PASAIDA Element:** Agitation
You already know you should diversify. You've tried. It failed. So you went back to doubling down on SEO because at least that's predictable.

Here's why that logic is backward:

A 90/10 traffic split (90% organic, 10% everything else) means a 50% algorithm hit kills 45% of your total traffic. You need 90% recovery just to get back to baseline.

A 60/20/10/10 split (organic, email, social, paid) means the same 50% organic hit only kills 30% of total traffic. Plus you have three other channels to activate for emergency traffic.

The math isn't about "doing more channels"—it's about reducing single-point failure risk.

Most publishers misunderstand this. They think diversification means splitting effort equally across 5 channels. Wrong. It means deliberate allocation based on ROI, correlation, and risk tolerance.

Tomorrow I'll show you how to calculate your target allocation based on your actual business model (not generic advice).

— Vic

---

**Email 3: Channel Correlation (Why SEO + Paid Search Isn't Diversification)**
**Subject:** SEO + Google Ads = fake diversification
**Preview:** The correlation trap most publishers fall into

**PASAIDA Element:** Solution
Quick test: When Google's September 2023 Helpful Content Update hit, did your paid search traffic also drop?

If yes, your channels are correlated. That means they move together—same volatility, same risk.

Real diversification requires low-correlation channels:
- Google Organic + Email (low correlation)
- Facebook Organic + Reddit (low correlation)
- SEO + YouTube (medium correlation)

Fake diversification (correlated channels):
- Google Organic + Google Paid (high correlation—same platform, same algorithm influence)
- Facebook + Instagram (same company, same policy risk)

Here's the framework:

**Platform Correlation Matrix**
- Same platform = high correlation (Google Organic + Google Ads)
- Same company = medium-high correlation (Facebook + Instagram)
- Same audience intent, different platform = medium correlation (SEO + YouTube for same keywords)
- Different intent + different platform = low correlation (SEO + Email)

Your goal: Max 50% allocation to any correlated channel group.

I'll send you the full correlation matrix tomorrow so you can audit your current setup.

**Email 4: Attribution Reality (Which Channels Actually Convert)**
**Subject:** Your analytics are lying about which channels work
**Preview:** Last-click attribution is why you're killing your best channels

**PASAIDA Element:** Authority
Google Analytics says your email converts at 0.5%. So you deprioritize it. Six months later you wonder why your traffic is more fragile than ever.

Here's what happened: Your attribution model is broken.

Last-click attribution (GA4 default) gives 100% conversion credit to the final touchpoint. That makes paid search and direct traffic look amazing. It makes SEO and email look terrible.

Reality: SEO and email are assist channels. They start the relationship. Paid and direct finish it.

When I run multi-touch attribution audits, here's what actually happens:

**Last-Click Model (GA4 Default):**
- Paid Search: 40% of conversions
- Direct: 30%
- Email: 5%

**Linear Multi-Touch Model (Equal Credit):**
- Email: 25% of conversions
- SEO: 30%
- Paid Search: 25%
- Direct: 20%

Email went from 5% to 25% just by changing the attribution model. No traffic changes. Same conversions. Different accounting.

If you're making budget decisions based on last-click data, you're systematically defunding your highest-leverage channels.

I built a simple attribution framework for publishers who don't have enterprise tools. It's a Google Sheet + UTM taxonomy + Zapier integration. Takes 2 hours to set up. I'll include it in tomorrow's email if you want it.

**Email 5: The Portfolio Course (Or Build It Yourself)**
**Subject:** Two ways to build your traffic portfolio
**Preview:** DIY roadmap vs guided 12-week program

**PASAIDA Elements:** Incentive, Deadline, Action

You've seen the framework. Now you have two paths:

**Path 1: Build It Yourself**
- Audit current allocation (HHI calculator from Day 1)
- Map channel correlations (matrix from Day 3)
- Fix attribution tracking (framework from Day 4)
- Select 2-3 new channels (selection criteria: margins, time, intent match)
- Test for 90 days, rebalance based on ROI

Timeline: 4-6 months if you're disciplined.
Cost: Free + your time.
Risk: Most people stall at channel selection or attribution setup.

**Path 2: The Traffic Portfolio Course**
12-week cohort program. I walk you through the exact buildout:
- Week 1-2: Audit + allocation targets
- Week 3-4: Attribution setup (I give you the templates)
- Week 5-6: Channel selection + testing framework
- Week 7-10: Implementation sprints (you build, I review)
- Week 11-12: Rebalancing protocols + maintenance systems

Includes: Traffic modeling spreadsheet, attribution templates, weekly group calls, private Slack access, portfolio teardowns.

Price: $497 (one-time)
Next cohort: March 3, 2026 (8 spots left)

I'm not going to pressure you. If you want to build it yourself, do it. The frameworks are all in these emails.

If you want the templates, accountability, and faster execution, join the waitlist here: [link]

Either way, fix your traffic allocation. A monoculture works until it doesn't. And when it breaks, you won't have time to build the alternative channels.

— Vic

**P.S.** If you're on the fence, reply to this email with your current traffic breakdown (% by channel). I'll tell you whether you should DIY or if your situation needs the full framework.

### Sequence 2: Sales/Launch (7 Emails)
**Audience:** Waitlist subscribers for The Traffic Portfolio course
**Goal:** Convert waitlist to $497 course enrollment during 7-day launch window

---

**Email 1: Doors Open (72-Hour Enrollment Window)**
**Subject:** The Traffic Portfolio—enrollment open (72 hours)
**Preview:** 12 weeks to build a multi-channel traffic system that survives algorithm chaos

**PASAIDA Element:** Problem + Deadline

Enrollment for The Traffic Portfolio opens today at 9am ET.

Closes Friday at 11:59pm ET (72 hours).

This is Cohort 2. Last cohort (November 2025) sold out in 48 hours. I capped this one at 25 people because I review every portfolio audit personally and run live teardowns on weekly calls.

Here's what you're walking into:

You're currently running 70-90% of your traffic from one channel. Probably Google. Maybe Facebook if you're in ecomm. Possibly Reddit if you're in a tight niche.

That channel works—until it doesn't.

September 2023: Helpful Content Update kills 60% of affiliate organic traffic overnight.
March 2024: Core Update hammers informational sites.
November 2024: Spam update nukes AI content farms (and catches legitimate publishers in crossfire).

Every 4-6 months, Google drops an update. Every time, publishers scramble. Every time, the same people get hit hardest: the ones who never diversified.

You already know this. The question isn't whether you should fix it. The question is whether you'll actually do it this time.

If you're ready to build the system, here's the link: [Enrollment Link]

If you want to read the full curriculum first, keep reading.

**PASAIDA Element:** Solution

Most traffic courses teach one channel. This one teaches the layer above: orchestration.

Here's the 12-week breakdown:

**Weeks 1-2: Portfolio Audit + Risk Assessment**
You'll calculate your current HHI score, map channel correlations, and identify single-point failure risks. Deliverable: Traffic Risk Report with target allocation strategy.

**Weeks 3-4: Attribution Architecture**
You'll build a multi-touch attribution system using Google Sheets, Zapier, and UTM taxonomy. No enterprise tools required. Deliverable: Working attribution dashboard tracking first-touch, last-touch, and linear models.

**Weeks 5-6: Channel Selection Framework**
You'll run your business model (margin, content format, time budget) through the selection matrix and identify 2-3 highest-probability channels to test. Deliverable: Channel testing roadmap with success metrics and kill criteria.

**Weeks 7-10: Implementation Sprints**
You'll activate your selected channels, run 30-day tests, and present results in weekly teardowns. I'll review your data and recommend optimizations or pivots. Deliverable: 3 new traffic channels live and tracked.

**Weeks 11-12: Rebalancing Protocols**
You'll build your ongoing maintenance system: quarterly portfolio reviews, rebalancing triggers, algorithm update response playbook. Deliverable: Traffic Portfolio Operating Manual (your custom playbook).

By Week 12 you'll have:
- Multi-channel traffic system (60/20/10/10 target allocation)
- Attribution framework showing true channel ROI
- Rebalancing protocols for quarterly maintenance
- Crisis response playbook for algorithm updates

That's the build. You in?

**Email 3: Who This Is For (And Who Should Skip It)**
**Subject:** If you're under $5k/mo revenue, don't buy this
**Preview:** The honest filter—who should join vs who should wait

**PASAIDA Element:** Authority (via exclusion)

This course isn't for everyone. Here's the filter:

**Don't Join If:**
- You're pre-revenue or under $5k/mo (focus on one channel first, diversify later)
- You're in agency-land doing client work (different model, different portfolio strategy)
- You have zero traffic currently (you need distribution before diversification)
- You want quick-fix tactics (this is a 12-week system build, not a 48-hour hack)

**Join If:**
- You're earning $5k-50k/mo from 1-2 traffic sources and know it's fragile
- You've been hit by algorithm updates before and refuse to let it happen again
- You've tried other channels randomly and failed—now you want a selection framework
- You're willing to invest 5-10 hours/week for 12 weeks to build the infrastructure

This isn't a beginner course. It assumes you already know how to execute on individual channels (SEO, paid ads, email, social). This teaches the layer above: allocation, attribution, risk management, rebalancing.

If that's where you're at, you're in the right place.

If not, bookmark this and come back when you hit $5k/mo on your primary channel.

**Email 4: The Cost of Waiting (What You Lose by Staying Fragile)**
**Subject:** The $30k cost of your next algorithm hit
**Preview:** What fragility actually costs (math from real publisher data)

**PASAIDA Element:** Agitation

Let's run the numbers on what your current traffic monoculture is costing you.

**Scenario: You're at $10k/mo revenue, 80% from Google organic.**

Next algorithm update hits (average every 4-6 months). Let's say it's mild—only 40% organic traffic loss.

Your revenue math:
- 80% of $10k = $8k from organic
- 40% loss = $3.2k/mo revenue drop
- Recovery timeline: 3-6 months (if you recover at all)
- Total cost: $9.6k - $19.2k in lost revenue

Now add in the emotional cost:
- Daily anxiety checking Search Console
- Can't plan beyond 90 days
- Every Google announcement triggers panic
- You're constantly one update away from a crisis

That's the cost of fragility.

Now contrast that with a diversified portfolio (60/20/10/10 split):

Same 40% organic hit:
- 60% of $10k = $6k from organic
- 40% loss = $2.4k from organic channel
- But total revenue only drops to $7.6k (24% total loss, not 32%)
- Plus you have email, social, and paid channels to activate for emergency traffic
- Recovery timeline: 4-8 weeks

Cost of the hit: $7.2k - $14.4k vs $9.6k - $19.2k in the monoculture scenario.

Diversification saves you $2.4k - $4.8k per algorithm event.

The Traffic Portfolio costs $497.

You save 5-10x that on the first algorithm update alone.

Still deciding whether it's worth it?

**Email 5: Case Study—How Sarah Went from 90% Google to 60/20/10/10 in 90 Days**
**Subject:** 90% Google → 60/20/10/10 in 90 days (case study)
**Preview:** Sarah's portfolio rebalancing roadmap (Cohort 1 student)

**PASAIDA Element:** Proof

Sarah runs an affiliate site in the home décor niche. November 2025 revenue: $18k/mo, 87% from Google organic.

She joined Cohort 1 in November. Here's what she built in 12 weeks:

**Week 1-2: Audit**
- HHI score: 7,569 (extreme concentration risk)
- Target allocation: 60% SEO, 25% email, 10% Pinterest, 5% YouTube
- Biggest gap: Zero owned audience (no email list)

**Week 3-4: Attribution Setup**
- Built UTM taxonomy for all traffic sources
- Set up Zapier → Google Sheets pipeline for conversion tracking
- Discovered email was assisting 30% of organic conversions (hadn't realized this before)

**Week 5-6: Channel Selection**
- Selected Pinterest (visual niche, high intent) and email (owned audience hedge)
- Decided against paid ads (margins too thin for her AOV)
- Set 90-day test budgets: $500 for Pinterest ads, 10 hrs/week for email growth

**Week 7-10: Implementation**
- Grew email list from 0 → 1,200 (lead magnet: "The Ultimate Gallery Wall Planning Guide")
- Launched Pinterest with 50 pins, ran $500 in promoted pins
- Email driving 8% of total traffic by Week 10, Pinterest at 4%

**Week 11-12: Rebalancing**
- New allocation: 75% SEO, 12% email, 8% Pinterest, 5% YouTube (in progress)
- HHI score dropped from 7,569 → 5,850 (still concentrated but improving)
- Revenue up to $19.5k/mo (diversification didn't hurt—it grew total traffic)

Her big insight: "I thought diversification meant sacrificing SEO. It didn't. I just added channels instead of replacing. Now when the next update hits, I have email and Pinterest to activate."

That's the build. 90 days. Measurable allocation shift. Revenue stable (actually grew).

You can do the same. Starts March 3.

**Email 6: Objection Handling (I Don't Have Time / I Tried Before / I'm Skeptical)**
**Subject:** "I don't have time to build this"
**Preview:** The three objections I hear most (and why they're wrong)

**PASAIDA Element:** Agitation + Solution

**Objection 1: "I don't have time to build a multi-channel system."**

You don't have time NOT to. You're currently spending 10+ hours/week on SEO because it's your only channel. One algorithm hit forces you into panic mode for 2-4 weeks trying to recover.

Diversification is time insurance. You spend 12 weeks building the system, then it runs on 5 hours/week maintenance. When the next update hits, you don't scramble—you activate your playbook.

Time cost of monoculture: Constant anxiety + periodic crisis mode.
Time cost of portfolio: 12-week build + 5 hrs/week maintenance.

---

**Objection 2: "I tried other channels before. They didn't work."**

You tried random tactics without a selection framework. Pinterest failed because you're in B2B SaaS (wrong audience). Paid ads burned money because your margin doesn't support paid CAC (wrong unit economics).

The Channel Selection Framework eliminates wrong-fit channels before you test. You're not trying everything—you're testing 2-3 channels matched to your business model.

Cohort 1 success rate: 65% of students achieved positive ROI on at least one new channel within 90 days. Industry average for random channel experiments: ~20%.

Framework > tactics.

---

**Objection 3: "How do I know this will work for my niche?"**

You don't. That's why we test with minimum viable budgets and kill criteria.

Week 5-6 you'll define success metrics for each channel. Week 7-10 you'll run tests. If a channel fails your criteria after 30 days, you kill it and test the next one.

This isn't a guarantee. It's a system for finding what works faster and cheaper than random experimentation.

You'll fail on some channels. Everyone does. The difference is you'll know when to quit and what to try next.

**Email 7: Final Call (Doors Close in 6 Hours)**
**Subject:** Last call—doors close at midnight
**Preview:** Final enrollment for The Traffic Portfolio (6 hours left)

**PASAIDA Element:** Deadline + Action

Six hours left.

You've seen the framework. You know your traffic is fragile. You know the next algorithm update is coming (they always do).

The question isn't whether you should fix it. The question is whether you'll actually do it.

Most people won't. They'll read the emails, nod along, then go back to checking Search Console every morning and hoping Google doesn't break their business.

If you're different—if you're ready to build the system instead of hoping the problem goes away—here's the link:

[Enrollment Link]

Cohort 2 starts March 3, 2026.
25 spots. 18 filled. 7 left.

Closes at 11:59pm ET tonight (January 26, 2026).

After tonight, waitlist for Cohort 3 (June 2026).

See you inside.

## 4. OBSERVER PROTOCOL — Social Media

### LinkedIn Posts (10 Hooks + Angles)

**Post 1: The Monoculture Problem**
Your traffic dashboard looks like a single stock portfolio.

87% Google organic.
9% direct.
4% everything else.

You wouldn't invest your retirement fund this way. Why are you running your business this way?

Traffic portfolio theory: Diversification reduces volatility without sacrificing returns. Same math, different asset class.

HHI score above 5000 = extreme concentration risk.

Calculate yours: [link to Traffic Risk Assessment]

---

**Post 2: Algorithm Update as Portfolio Stress Test**
September 2023 Helpful Content Update killed 60% of affiliate organic traffic.

The publishers who survived had one thing in common: email lists.

Not better SEO. Not smarter content. Just an owned audience to activate when the rented channel failed.

Algorithm updates aren't SEO failures. They're portfolio failures.

---

**Post 3: The Attribution Lie**
Google Analytics says paid search drives 40% of your conversions.

Multi-touch attribution says email drives 30% and paid drives 15%.

Same conversions. Different accounting.

Last-click attribution systematically defunds your best channels.

You're making budget decisions on bad data.

---

**Post 4: Channel Correlation Trap**
"We diversified—we do SEO and Google Ads now."

That's not diversification. That's the same platform twice.

When Google's algorithm changes, both channels move together. High correlation = concentrated risk.

Real diversification: SEO + email + Reddit. Different platforms, different algorithms, low correlation.

---

**Post 5: Traffic as Portfolio Asset Class**
Every traffic source has:
- Expected return (revenue per visitor)
- Volatility (traffic consistency month-over-month)
- Correlation with other channels (do they move together?)

You can calculate optimal allocation using the same math as stock portfolio management.

Except most publishers don't. They just "try stuff."

---

**Post 6: The 60/20/10/10 Rule**
Safe starting allocation for most content businesses:

60% — Primary channel (usually SEO)
20% — Owned audience (email list)
10% — Secondary platform (Pinterest, YouTube, Reddit)
10% — Paid or experimental

Rebalance quarterly based on ROI and risk exposure.

This isn't a tactic. It's infrastructure.

---

**Post 7: Cost Per Visitor Reality**
"SEO is free traffic."

No it's not.

15 hours/week content production.
$200/mo tool stack (Ahrefs, GSC, Screaming Frog).
6-month lag before traffic compounds.

Amortized CPV for SEO: $0.80-$2.50 depending on your hourly rate.

Paid ads: $0.40-$3.00 depending on channel and niche.

"Free" and "expensive" are accounting tricks. Calculate true CPV or make bad decisions.

---

**Post 8: Platform Risk Scoring**
Rate your traffic sources on three axes:

1. Control: Owned > Earned > Rented > Paid
2. Concentration: What % of total traffic?
3. Correlation: Do they move together or independently?

High control + low concentration + low correlation = resilient portfolio.

Most publishers optimize for short-term growth. Then an algorithm hits and they lose 50% revenue in 48 hours.

---

**Post 9: Email as Portfolio Anchor**
The only channel you own.

Zero correlation with algorithm updates.
Highest ROI per visitor (data from 500+ publishers).
Portable across platform changes.

If you're not growing an email list, your traffic portfolio has no anchor.

When the storm comes, you'll drift.

---

**Post 10: Rebalancing Triggers**
When to shift budget between channels:

1. One channel exceeds 50% allocation (concentration risk)
2. ROI drops 30%+ below historical average (performance decline)
3. Correlation increases (two channels start moving together)

Most publishers never rebalance. They set it once, then ignore it until something breaks.

Quarterly portfolio reviews prevent crisis mode.

### Twitter/X Threads (10 Starters)

**Thread 1: The Algorithm Update Survival Protocol**
Your site just lost 50% of its Google traffic overnight.

Here's the 72-hour response protocol that saved 30+ publishers during the November 2024 update:

Hour 1-6: Data collection
- Export GSC data (last 90 days)
- Identify affected pages vs unaffected
- Check competitors (did they drop too?)

**Thread 2: Channel Economics Breakdown**
Let's calculate the TRUE cost per visitor for every major channel.

SEO, paid ads, email, social—real numbers, no BS.

Thread 🧵

[1/12]

SEO cost per visitor:

Time: 15 hrs/week content + 5 hrs/week technical
Hourly rate: $50 (your time cost)
Tools: $200/mo (Ahrefs, GSC, Screaming Frog)
Output: 10,000 visitors/mo

CPV = ($1,000 time + $200 tools) / 10,000 = $0.12

But that's month 6. Months 1-5 you had zero traffic...
