# Landing Page: Traffic Portfolio Risk Calculator

---

## ABOVE THE FOLD

### Headline
**72% Google Organic Is a Crisis Waiting to Happen**

### Subheadline
Calculate your Traffic Portfolio Risk Score in 3 minutes. Get your HHI score, channel correlation map, and prioritized rebalancing plan.

### Primary CTA Button
**Get My Risk Score Free**

### Supporting Stat (visual element)
Sites with HHI scores above 5,000 take 12-20 weeks to recover from algorithm updates. Sites under 2,500 recover in 4-6 weeks.

---

## SECTION 1: LEAD (The Emotional Hook)

### You Know This Feeling

Search Console before coffee. The graph is down 15%. Heart rate spikes. You open Reddit to check for algorithm update threads. Nothing confirmed yet. You refresh GSC. Still down.

The September 2023 Helpful Content Update wiped out 60% of affiliate organic traffic in 48 hours. March 2024 Core Update hammered informational sites. November 2024 spam update caught legitimate publishers in crossfire.

Every 4-6 months, Google drops something. Every time, the same sites get crushed: the ones running 70%+ from a single channel.

---

## SECTION 2: IDENTIFY (The Problem Defined)

### This Isn't a Traffic Problem. It's a Concentration Problem.

Portfolio theory applies to traffic the same way it applies to stocks. Harry Markowitz won a Nobel Prize proving that diversification reduces risk without proportionally reducing returns.

The Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) measures concentration in any portfolio. Economists use it to assess market monopoly risk. Works identically for traffic allocation.

**The Math Is Simple:**

| Your Allocation | HHI Score | Risk Level |
|-----------------|-----------|------------|
| 90% / 10% | 8,200 | Extreme |
| 70% / 20% / 10% | 5,400 | High |
| 40% / 30% / 20% / 10% | 3,000 | Low-Moderate |

Most publishers running 70%+ organic haven't calculated their HHI. They know they're concentrated. They don't know how concentrated—or what to do about it.

---

## SECTION 3: SOLUTION (What They Get)

### The Traffic Portfolio Risk Calculator

15-question assessment. 3 minutes. You get:

**1. Your HHI Concentration Score**
Exact number based on your current traffic allocation. No guessing, no estimates. Pull the numbers from GA4, plug them in, see where you land on the risk spectrum.

**2. Channel Correlation Map**
Which of your channels move together? Google Organic + Google Ads = same platform, same algorithm influence. When one drops, both drop. That's not diversification—it's the same bet twice. The assessment identifies your hidden correlation risks.

**3. Owned vs. Rented Ratio**
Email is owned. Social followers are earned. SEO is rented—Google controls the terms. Paid stops when you stop paying. Your ratio determines how much of your traffic you actually control.

**4. Your Traffic Risk Profile**
Critical / High / Moderate / Low. Based on the combination of concentration, correlation, and ownership. With specific context for what that profile predicts about your next algorithm update.

**5. Prioritized Rebalancing Plan**
Not theory. Exact recommendations based on your scores. 90-day email growth protocol if your owned audience is weak. Channel selection framework if you need to add uncorrelated sources. Rebalancing triggers so you know when to act.

**6. Google Sheet Calculator**
Track your HHI monthly. Auto-alerts when any channel exceeds threshold. Algorithm update log to compare portfolio performance across events.

## SECTION 4: EVIDENCE (The Proof)

### Data from 200+ Publisher Traffic Portfolios (2023-2025)

**Recovery Time After Algorithm Update**

| HHI Score | Average Recovery Time |
|-----------|-----------------------|
| <2,500 | 4-6 weeks |
| 2,500-5,000 | 8-12 weeks |
| 5,000-7,500 | 12-20 weeks |
| >7,500 | 20+ weeks (many never fully recover) |

**Revenue Volatility by Concentration**

| HHI Score | Monthly Revenue Variance |
|-----------|--------------------------|
| <2,500 | +/- 8% |
| 2,500-5,000 | +/- 15% |
| 5,000-7,500 | +/- 28% |
| >7,500 | +/- 45% |

**Email List Impact During HCU (September 2023)**

Sites with email lists representing 25%+ of traffic lost the same organic traffic as everyone else—but retained 4x more revenue because they activated the owned channel.

## BELOW-FOLD STRUCTURE

### Section Order

1. **The Problem Expanded** — Algorithm update timeline (HCU Sep 2023, March 2024 Core, November 2024 Spam). The pattern: concentrated sites get hit hardest, recover slowest.

2. **The Mechanism** — Brief on HHI calculation. Portfolio theory crossover. Why correlation matters as much as concentration.

3. **What You Get** — Full breakdown of all 6 deliverables with specifics on each.

4. **The Data** — Tables on recovery time, revenue volatility, email list impact. Visual proof that diversification works.

5. **About** — Brief credibility marker. Not a bio dump. One line on who built this and why.

6. **FAQ** — Anticipated objections (see below).

7. **Final CTA** — Repeat form. Same button text.

## FAQ SECTION

**How long does the assessment take?**
15 questions, 3 minutes. You'll need your traffic percentages from GA4 (or estimates are fine for a baseline).

**What if I don't know my exact traffic percentages?**
Estimates work for directional insight. The calculator will show you how to pull precise numbers from GA4 if you want to run it again with actuals.

**Is this just going to tell me to build an email list?**
The assessment measures three factors: concentration, correlation, and ownership. Email is one lever. The recommendations depend on your specific risk profile. Some sites need channel diversification more than email growth.

**What happens after I submit my email?**
You get the full assessment, scoring instructions, and Google Sheet calculator immediately. Then a 7-day email sequence diving deeper into each risk factor. No sales calls. Unsubscribe anytime.

**Is there a paid version?**
Yes. The Traffic Portfolio Course is a 12-week cohort program with live calls, portfolio teardowns, and implementation support. Next cohort: March 3, 2026. $497. The free assessment stands alone—no upsell required.

- Tables: use actual tables, not bullet conversions. The data is the proof.
- Form: inline above-fold, repeated at bottom. Minimal fields.
- Mobile: stack headline > subhead > CTA > supporting stat. Form visible without scroll.
